##      - v 1.0: Script created
##
## This script hast two parts. The first part loads the training and the test sets of the Human Activity
## Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset v1.0 [1] and merges them into one data set "humanActivityRecog",
## assigning descriptive names to the variables and appending the subjects of the experiment as well as the
## activities they performed while recording the accelerometer values.
##
## The second part takes the "humanActivityRecog" set and creates the "averagesHAR" set, consisting of the
## mean of each variable of the "humanActivityRecog" set for each activity and each subject.
## As a final step it exports the "averagesHAR" set to the "averagesHAR.csv" comma-separated-values file in
## the current working directory.

## Setting up the environment.
##
# Load required libraries.
require(utils)
require(data.table)
require(dplyr)
require(tidyr)

# Define some paths to simplify later.
pathData <- "./data/UCI HAR Dataset/"
pathTest <- "./data/UCI HAR Dataset/test/"
pathTrain <- "./data/UCI HAR Dataset/train/"

## Check if the data in its own directory "./data", download otherwise and unzip if necessary

}

## First part: load the necessary variables from the training and test sets, attach the subject and activities
## codes, and finally merge the training and the test sets.

# Load the variables names from the list provided. The list has to be transposed to have each name as a
# variable.

varNames <- gsub("^[fF]", "FFT", varNames) # Changes the initial "f" of the frequency-domain measurements to
                                           # the more descriptive "FFT": Fast Fourier Transform.
varNames <- gsub("t(Bo)|t(Gr)", "\\1", varNames) # Removes the "t" from other names.
varNames <- gsub("([0-9]+),([0-9])", "Bins\\1to\\2", varNames) # Makes names more explicit.
varNames <- gsub("(ArCoeff)-([XYZ]{1}),([0-9]{1})", "\\1\\3-\\2", varNames) # Same as above.

## Second part.
